# 📱 GlobeSubsApp

A SwiftUI app that displays a list of Globe Telecom subscribers with their photo, name, address, and subscription type (Prepaid or Postpaid).

This project demonstrates:
- Clean architecture with SOLID principles
- Offline-first approach using **SwiftData (iOS 17+)** or **Core Data (iOS 16)**
- Modern iOS practices including Swift Concurrency, MVVM, dependency injection, and more
- Integration with [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) for networking and [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher) for image caching
