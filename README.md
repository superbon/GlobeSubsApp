ðŸ“± GlobeSubsApp

GlobeSubsApp is a modern SwiftUI iOS application that displays a list of Globe subscribers with their photo, name, address, and subscription type (Prepaid or Postpaid). It fetches data from a remote JSON API, caches it using SwiftData, and works seamlessly offline. Designed with clean architecture and SOLID principles in mind.
